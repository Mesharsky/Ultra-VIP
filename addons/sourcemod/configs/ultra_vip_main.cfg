"UltraVIP - Configuration"
{
    ////////////////////////////////
    // Configuration Instructions
    //
    // -------- INFO --------
    // The config has 2 main sections:
    // Global configuration    -- Settings for the whole plugin.
    // Services                -- A list of each service that can be given to players and its settings.
    //
    // -------- SERVICES --------
    // A "service" is what Ultra-VIP calls a group of settings that can be applied to a player.
    // Think of them like groups with permissions (similar to discord roles, if that is clearer).
    //
    // The plugin supports an unlimited number of services, but players can only have access to 1 at a time.
    //
    // Services can be assigned to players using any of the following:
    //    1) Admin Flags (Legacy permission system)
    //    2) Admin Overrides (Group permission system)
    //    3) Manually assigning to a SteamID.
    //
    // Pick whichever one you prefer to use for your server.
    //
    // If a player has access to more than one service, they will only get whichever service has
    // the higher "priority" setting.
    // Currently, priority does not work with override access.
    //
    // -------- ROUNDS --------
    // Features can be enabled by a specific round.
    // The number always refers to the rounds since the start of the half, with "1" being the pistol round.
    //
    // -------- ROOT ADMIN --------
    // Root admins will not get any service unless the "root_service" setting is set (in Global configuration).
    //
    // -------- CHAT COLORS --------
    // Some features will say they support chat colors.
    // This is the list of colours that are supported:
    //
    //    {default}, {darkred}, {green}, {lightgreen}, {red}, {blue}, {olive}, {lime}, {lightred}, {purple}
    //    {grey}, {yellow}, {orange}, {bluegrey}, {lightblue}, {darkblue}, {grey2}, {orchid}, {lightred2}
